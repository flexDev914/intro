Welcome to the Intro to Open Source Course with OpenSauced! This course is designed to provide you with an introduction to open source and guide you through the process of contributing to open source projects.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the world of open source, it's essential to have a basic understanding of programming concepts and some experience working with code. While the course will provide examples and demos, you'll get the most out of the material if you have some prior knowledge.

Additionally, this course assumes that you are familiar with Git and GitHub. Git is a widely-used version control system, and GitHub is a popular platform for hosting and collaborating on Git repositories. If you're not already familiar with Git and GitHub, we recommend taking some time to learn the basics before starting this course.

## Course Overview

## Expectations

This course is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in open source collaboration. While we'll cover a range of topics and provide examples, demos, and opportunities for hands-on practice, it's essential to have realistic expectations about what you can achieve during the course.

1. **Practice is crucial**: Learning about open source is just the beginning; to truly develop your skills and become a proficient contributor, you'll need to practice consistently. Keep in mind that the more you contribute to open source projects, the more you'll learn and grow as a developer.

2. **Patience is key**: Becoming proficient in open source collaboration takes time and effort. Don't be discouraged if you encounter challenges along the way; remember that every contribution, no matter how small, is valuable and helps improve the project.

3. **Engagement with the community**: Open source is more than just code; it's about the people who collaborate and contribute to projects. Engage with the community by asking questions, sharing your knowledge, and supporting others. Building relationships with other contributors will enhance your open source experience and help you grow as a developer.

4. **Continuous learning**: Open source is a rapidly evolving field, with new projects, tools, and technologies emerging all the time. Stay curious and open to learning, and take advantage of resources like documentation, tutorials, and community forums to expand your knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest developments.

5. **Developing a growth mindset**: Embrace the challenges and opportunities that come with open source collaboration. Adopt a growth mindset, which focuses on learning, improvement, and resilience. By viewing obstacles as opportunities for growth, you'll be better equipped to navigate the complex world of open source and achieve success in your contributions.
