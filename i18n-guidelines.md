# 🌐 i18n Guide

At the moment, we have the course in the following languages:  

* Brazilian Portuguese
* English
* French

## How can I contribute?

* **Translate our README**. There are two methods of translation contributions we accept.
  * **Official Translations**: Official translations start as a post in our discussion board. If there is enough interest and volunteers, we can add the official translation as an option to view within our README.
  * **Community Translations**: We can’t always support the maintenance of translations. However, we do know that there are contributors out there willing to translate. For that reason, we have our Community Translations section. If you’ve forked the repository and created a translation, you can add a link to your forked translation to `community-translations.md`. We encourage you to also add it to the discussion board in the event it becomes popular enough and has enough support to be moved to an official translation.
* **Review PRs and translations.** New to reviewing GitHub PRs and translations? No worries, we have you covered in our [Reviewer Process Guide](#reviewer-process-guide).

## Reviewer Process Guide

When it comes to reviewing a translation pull request (PR), ask yourself the following questions:

* Does the current translation match the instructions in the English version?
* Are there links that could be localized? (e.g. Wikipedia and MDN links)
* Is the translation correctly written following the translated language's norms and practices?

When you think a PR is ready to be merged after your suggestions were addressed (if any), approve it through GitHub's "Review Changes" button or leave an "LGTM!" in the comment section and tag one of the maintainers. (“LGTM” is an abbreviation of “Looks Good to Me” or “Let’s Get to Merging”, often used to approve pull requests.)
