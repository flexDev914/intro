# Introduction to contributing
Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small. Before contributing, please read the [code of conduct](https://docs.opensauced.pizza/contributing/code-of-conduct/) and follow the directions below:

# Recommended Communication Style
1. Always leave screenshots for visual changes
2. Always leave a detailed description in the Pull Request. Leave nothing ambiguous for the viewer(s).
3. Always review your code first. Be sure to run the project locally and test it before asking for a review.
4. Always communicate in the GitHub repository. Whether it is in the issue or the pull request, keeping the lines of communication open and visible to everyone on the team helps everyone around you.
